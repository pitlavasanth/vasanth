This is to develop online pdf to audio converter .In this we can convert any pdf to audio form  .There is a wide spread talk about improvement of human interface to the computer because no longer people want to sit and read the data . So ,voice is a better interface when it comes to illiterate people rather than GUI in English .In this you can easily convert text into speech which will also help blind people .User will be able to insert the file which is to be converted into audio file .In this website we also have a text box which can convert the text into audio with customizable voices .This will make our work easy and have stable output
